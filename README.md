# EV-Battery-Project
Repository to track a prediction model that uses a Kaggle.AI dataset to predict prices of batteries and average prices of Electric cars in the United States. We model the dataset using the regression model, while implementing libraries such as pytorch, scikit learn and matplotlib for data.
